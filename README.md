# A Simple Login/Register Setup
This is a sign-in template built with Firebase Authentication for security. The template allows users to sign up, log in, and manage authentication easily. You can install and customize it to suit your needs.

**REUSE DON'T REDO**
A simple but powerful statement. It's what lead me to create this login/register template so that I don't have to remake one every time I'm beginning a new project.

## Features
- User sign-up and login
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Email/password-based authentication

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Firebase Account**: You'll need to create a Firebase account and set up a Firebase project for managing authentication.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AuthPass.git


**A Watched Pot Never Boils**
This is basically just a boiler template. But it not going to be of much use if it don't get used. So, let's get this started!
