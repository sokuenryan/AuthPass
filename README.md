# A Simple Login/Register Setup

**REUSE DON'T REDO**
A simple but powerful statement. It's what lead me to create this login/register template so that I don't have to remake one every time I'm beginning a new project.

**User Authentication**
I created this with Firebase running the Authentication system. 

**A Watched Pot Never Boils**
This is basically just a boiler template. But it not going to be of much use if it don't get used. So, let's get this started!

# DISCLAIMER: 
**There is purposefully barely any CSS styling involved on purpose because it's going to be changed up later, anyway.**
*Of course; any thoughts, comments, or ideas are welcome if you have any.*
