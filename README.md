# Auth-FirePass:
### A Simple Login/Register Setup
This is a sign-in template built with Firebase Authentication for security. The template allows users to sign up, log in, and manage authentication easily. You can install and customize it to suit your needs.

### Inspiration
**Based on the principle** ***RE-USE DON'T REDO***
A simple but powerful statement. It's what lead me to create this login/register template so that I don't have to remake one every time I'm beginning a new project.

## Features
- User sign-up and login
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Email/password-based authentication
