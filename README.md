# AuthPass

AuthPass is a boiler plate package for easily integrating Firebase authentication into your React applications. It provides a simple setup for user authentication with a login and registration page.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication**: Seamlessly integrate Firebase Auth for user authentication.
- **Pre-configured Pages**: Includes pre-built pages for Login and Registration.
- **Automatic File Setup**: Installing the npm package automatically downloads all necessary files into your project.

## Installation

  To install AuthPass, run the following command:
  ```bash
    npm install auth-pass
  ```
This will install AuthPass and automatically create the following directory structure in your project:

```markdown
- firebase/
    - firebase-config.js
- components/
    - Nav.jsx
- pages/
    - Login.jsx
    - Register.jsx
    - Homepage.jsx
    - Error.jsx
```

### Version
This package is currently at version 0.0.1.

### Usage
After installation, you can use the pre-built login and registration components in your React application. Make sure to configure Firebase in the 
`firebase/firebase-config.js` file to set up your Firebase project. 

Here's a README section you can include in your project that explains the Firebase account requirement and how to set it up for your `AuthPass` project.

### Firebase Setup

To use the authentication functionality provided by **AuthPass**, you'll need to set up a Firebase account and project. This is required because Firebase Authentication handles the login and registration processes. Follow these steps to configure Firebase for your app:

#### 1. Create a Firebase Project
- Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Click on **Add Project**.
- Enter your project name and click **Continue**.
- Disable **Google Analytics** (if you don't need it), then click **Create Project**.
- Once your project is created, click **Continue** to open the project dashboard.

#### 2. Add Firebase to Your Web App
- In your Firebase project, click on the **</> Web** icon to create a new Web app.
- Register the app with a name (e.g., `AuthPass`), and click **Register App**.
- Firebase will provide a configuration object with API keys. Copy this information for the next step.

#### 3. Update `firebase-config.js`
- After installing **AuthPass**, navigate to `firebase/firebase-config.js` in your project.
- Replace the default configuration with your Firebase project's credentials.

```jsx
// firebase/firebase-config.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
```

#### 4. Enable Firebase Authentication
- In the Firebase console, go to **Authentication** in the left sidebar.
- Click on **Get Started** and enable the sign-in methods you want (e.g., Email/Password, Google).
- Your Firebase Authentication is now ready!

#### 5. Testing the Setup
After setting up Firebase and updating the config file, you're ready to use the login and register pages in **AuthPass**. Simply run your project, and you should be able to authenticate users through Firebase.

By following these steps, you'll be able to leverage Firebase's authentication system within the `AuthPass` project.
